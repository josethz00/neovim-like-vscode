# Make your NeoVim looks like VSCode 
This is a public repo, that contains some settings and plugins that allows you to use NeoVim like Visual Studio Code. 
#### You can clone the repository into your nvim folder, or enter the repository files, and copy only the settings you need

#### To display the icons correctly, make sure your terminal is using a Nerd Font, here is the link to check the fonts: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#patched-fonts
